I am currently a Pre-Doctoral research fellow at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), with research interests in industrial organization and applied econometrics, focusing on oil and gas production. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Brandeis University, MA, with a degree in Economics (highest honors) and Mathematics (honors).

I was born and raised in Beijing, China.
