I am currently a Pre-Doctoral research fellow at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), with research interests in industrial organization and applied econometrics, focusing on oil and gas production. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Brandeis University, MA, with a degree in Economics (highest honors) and Mathematics (honors).

I was born and raised in Beijing, China. I have 2 cats, one domestic short hair and one domestic long hair. They currently live with my girlfriend in Waltham.

I am a die-hard Boston Celtics fan who developed the love for the Red Sox and the Patriots since moving to MA in 2015. Beat LA!
